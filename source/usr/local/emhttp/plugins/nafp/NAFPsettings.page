<div>While the utmost care and testing has been put into the development of this <strong>experimental addon</strong>, please be advised:</div>
<div>AFP is a <strong>deprecated legacy protocol</strong> which was removed from UNRAID for a reason, it is no longer supported officially.</div>
<br>
<div>The AFP service, when enabled, always starts and stops <strong>together with your disk array</strong>.</div>
<div>Some settings and operations are therefore enabled or disabled depending on the state of your array.</div>
